## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `agentworkforce agent` now records launch metadata for direct harness
  launches; opt out with `--no-launch-metadata` or
  `AGENTWORKFORCE_LAUNCH_METADATA=0`.
- `agentworkforce create` now opens `persona-maker@best`, supports `--to` and
  `--save-default`, and passes `TARGET_DIR` / `CREATE_MODE` persona inputs.
- Persona source config supports `defaultCreateTarget` for the implicit create target.
- `--version`/`-v` now prints the CLI package version.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Opencode interactive sessions** — launch opencode as an alternative runtime alongside Claude Code, with full mount/sync parity and agent abstraction (#20, #23)
- **Persona maker** — create and edit personas from the CLI (#22)
- **Animated sync spinner** on the SIGINT exit path — 1st Ctrl-C starts an ora spinner with "Syncing… (Ctrl-C again to skip)", 2nd Ctrl-C aborts, 3rd force-exits (#24)

### Fixed

- Opencode agent now defaults to `permission: 'allow'` so it can actually edit files
- `configFiles` written by `onBeforeLaunch` are hidden from the mount-mirror in both directions — prevents masking a user's existing `opencode.json` on the way in and polluting the working tree on the way out (#23)
- Sync-exit line no longer misreports direction: "Synced N change(s) back to the repo" → "N file event(s) during session", since `onAfterSync`'s count is bidirectional and includes inbound initial-mirror events (#24)

### Changed

- Safe-path validation on persona `configFiles` materialization — rejects empty, absolute, and `..`-traversal paths so a malformed persona can't escape the mount (#23)
- Exhaustiveness guard in `buildInteractiveSpec` so future `Harness` union additions fail at compile time rather than silently at runtime (#23)
